            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)<br> is the most basic building block<br> of the Web.
                It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
                Structure and Formatting: HTML uses tags and attributes to describe the structure and formatting of a web page. 
                These elements help define how content should be displayed.
                Elements: HTML consists of various elements, such as headings, lists, images, links, and more. 
                These elements allow you to organize and present content effectively1.
                Building Blocks: HTML is one of the fundamental building blocks for creating websites. 
                Understanding HTML is crucial for designing accessible and user-friendly sites

                 <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling 
                    of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                     CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                     Faster Page Speed
                    More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to a
                    ll occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.
                     Better User Experience
                    CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. 
                    When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.
                     Quicker Development Time
                    With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. 
                    One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have 
                    product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice 
                    for all pages of that same type.</p>
